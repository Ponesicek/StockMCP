## ü§ñ What is StockMCP?

StockMCP is an open-source experiment that explores what happens when artificial intelligence is given the ability to trade stocks autonomously. This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the Alpaca trading API, allowing AI models to interact with real financial markets.

This is purely an **educational and research project** designed to:
- Explore AI decision-making in financial markets
- Test the capabilities and limitations of AI trading systems
- Provide a foundation for academic research into algorithmic trading
- Demonstrate the integration of AI with financial APIs

## üö® Risk Warning

**NEVER USE THIS WITH REAL MONEY UNLESS YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS**

- This software is experimental and may contain bugs
- AI trading decisions can be unpredictable and may result in significant losses
- Market conditions can change rapidly and unpredictably
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- You are solely responsible for any trading decisions and their consequences

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This project uses:
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for AI integration
- **Alpaca Trade API** for stock market access
- **Docker** for containerized deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Alpaca Trading Account (paper trading recommended)

## üöÄ Usage


This MCP server provides AI models with trading capabilities through the Alpaca API. The server implements various trading functions that can be called by compatible AI systems.

**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**: Use only with Alpaca's paper trading environment.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ponesicek/StockMCP
cd StockMCP
```

2. Make an alpaca account at https://alpaca.markets/

3. Create a `.env` file with your Alpaca credentials:
```env
ALPACA_KEY=your_api_key_here
ALPACA_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2  # Use paper trading URL
```

4. Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
npm run docker:dev
```

5. Configure your preferred MCP client (e.g., Claude, Gemini CLI, Cursor) to connect to the StockMCP server using the following setup:
```json
    "stock-mcp": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": ["exec", "-i", "stock-mcp-server", "node", "dist/index.js"]
}
```
